# Sparkle Robot

Welcome to the Sparkle Robot organization! We are dedicated to developing advanced robotics solutions for the robotic comptitions 

## About Us

The Sparkle Robot organization is a collaborative effort by a group of enthusiastic undergraduates from the University of Moratuwa. Our mission is to design and build innovative robots that can perform complex tasks using cutting-edge technologies such as computer vision, deep learning, and advanced sensor systems.

## Our Projects

### 1. SLRC-Sparkle-Robot
- **Description:** The main project of our organization, focusing on the development of a line-following robot with capabilities in computer vision, object detection, metal detection, and payload transportation.
- **Technologies:** C++, TensorFlow, OpenCV, PID controllers, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, ToF sensors.
- **Repository:** [SLRC-Sparkle-Robot](https://github.com/SLRC-Vision-based-Robot/SLRC-Sparkle-Robot)

### 2. SLRC-vision-system
- **Description:** A computer vision system designed to identify 3D objects and colors using deep learning and OpenCV. This system is a critical component of the SLRC Sparkle Robot project.
- **Technologies:** Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, OpenCV.
